# Image Comparer

Compare images in a giffy, especially useful for pixel-peepers like me!

## Example

We want to compare the following 2 images - which one is sharper? Better focused?

<img src="readme_files/08042025_DSC_7392.JPG" alt="Image 1" width="400"/>

<img src="readme_files/08042025_DSC_7393.JPG" alt="Image 2" width="400"/>

Very difficult, isn't it?


Let us see both these images at 200% crop - 


<img src="readme_files/08042025_DSC_7392_Crop.JPG" alt="Image 1 200% crop" width="800"/>

<img src="readme_files/08042025_DSC_7393_Crop.JPG" alt="Image 2 200% crop" width="800"/>

Almost the same! So difficult to compare!

But what if you want to select only one image? Compare both of them to their finest accuracy - how each pixel stands out?

So this is where Image Comparator comes in!

We notice that the second image (08042025_DSC_7393_Crop.JPG) is slightly sharper - a detail very hard to notice without Image Comparator!
